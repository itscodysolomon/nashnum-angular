  <p>The <strong>Nashville Number System</strong> is a method of transcribing music by denoting the scale degree on which a chord is built. It was developed by Neal Matthews in the late 1950s as a simplified system for The Jordanaires to use in the studio and further developed by Charlie McCoy.</p>
  <p>Instead of using chords (like "G, D, Em, C"), the NNS uses numbers, and the numbers represent scale degrees. For example, in the key of C, it would be: C=1, Dm=2, Em=3, F=4, G=5, Am=6, G#ยบ=7, C=1. The chart below makes this clear for each of the keys:</p>
