  <p>Nashnum is a simple tool made to help musicians become more familiarized with the <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nashville_number_system">Nashville Number System</a></strong>.</p>
  <p>The Nashville Number System is a method of transcribing music by denoting the scale degree on which a chord is built. It was developed by Neal Matthews in the late 1950s as a simplified system for The Jordanaires to use in the studio and further developed by Charlie McCoy.</p>
  <p>Instead of using chords (like "G, D, Em, C"), the NNS uses numbers, and the numbers represent scale degrees.<br>For example, in the key of C, it would be:<br>C = 1, Dm = 2, Em = 3, F = 4, G = 5, Am = 6, BÂº = 7.<br></p>
  <p>The chart below makes this clear for each of the keys:</p>
